# News of the Day - A Worst Of
##what's that
a little script that get the most viewed article abstracts from various nytimes sections. it then analyses the words in groups of four using [indico.io](https://indico.io) to determine their *sentiment* value. It only picks the very *saddest* and constructs a small (poetic) "news report" with them.<br><br>
it's called ascript.py because when I started it I didn't have a clue what I wanted to make. the idea came on the go while writing "a script".
##sad examples
this is a real dark and grim one, the darkest I've come across (yet)<br>
